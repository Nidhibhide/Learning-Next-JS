## Next.js Basics

1. Next.js is a React framework. It’s like an upgraded version of React, created by Vercel.
2. SEO Friendly – It can show data to Google, which is good for ranking.



### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

* Rendering happens in the browser using JavaScript.
* When to use: Highly interactive apps such as dashboards and single-page applications.
* Client side handles both rendering and data fetching.
* Real-world use: Admin dashboards, chat apps, or applications where SEO is not critical.


### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

* Default behavior: Rendering happens on the server for every request.
* The server prepares full HTML (with data) and sends it to the browser.
* When to use: SEO-focused pages such as blogs, news, or e-commerce product pages.
* Best for: Content that changes on every request, for example, logged-in user dashboards.



### Static Site Generation (SSG)

* Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML.
* No server computation is needed at request time.
* Benefits: Super fast and CDN-friendly.
* When to use: Content that rarely changes, such as marketing sites, documentation, or blogs.



### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

* A hybrid of SSG and SSR.
* Pages are pre-rendered at build time like SSG.
* Pages automatically refresh in the background after a set interval (`revalidate`).
* When to use: Content that doesn’t change often but still needs periodic updates, such as blogs, documentation, or marketing pages.

-Scripts of next js 
1]next dev - start development server 
2]next start - start production server 

-File and folder structure 
1]public - The folder contains static assests i.e images , etc
2]If i create folder like 'about' in that i created 'about.jsx' file then it never display page after run '/about' It should be named as 'page.jsx' not even index.jsx 

-check about <metha name="viewport" content> check for responsiveness

-i know about next js how we use meta tag but how we have used in react js 
-what is use of authors tag in meta data 
-add fav icon in app 

-Client and Server component 
1]In React , we every component is Client component 
2]In app folder , by default every component is React Server Component 
3]In app , folder name should be in lowercase?
4]solve example of RSC and RCC
5]In RSC , " USE API KEYS,TOKENS AND OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT EXPOSING THEM TO CLIENT. i.e network tab from browser but in RCC we can see info easily.
6]#IMP - " If RCC imports another component that imported one becomes a RCC too , even If it doesnt have "use client" (i.e RSC).

-Dynamic Route Segments 
1]params - we can get value pf dynamic routing URL 
2]Example of dynamic routing and nesting routes
3]We can use only Dynamic Routes Segments in Server Components.
4]How to implement in RCC using useParams()

1]searchParams - its like query paramter for filtering , sorting and pagination 
2]Example of Filtering , sorting , pagination , search , dynamic deals in RSC 

1]useSearchParams - It same working like searchParams used in RCC
2]Use getAll() to get multiple values ,

1]catch all segments in URL params [...slug] ( in RSC)
2]Implementation in RCC using useParams()

-Data Fetching in RSC
1]Use fetch api and pass data via search Query
2]Add validation for no data passsed and empty string too
API = https://api.genderize.io/?name=peter

-Data Fetching in RCC
1]Use fetch api and pass data via search Query

E-commerce App
//1]make filters responsive sidebar

//3]Display category 
//4]asc and desc for rating and price 
5]add pagination
