## Next.js Basics

1. Next.js is a React framework. It’s like an upgraded version of React, created by Vercel.
2. SEO Friendly – It can show data to Google, which is good for ranking.



### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

* Rendering happens in the browser using JavaScript.
* When to use: Highly interactive apps such as dashboards and single-page applications.
* Client side handles both rendering and data fetching.
* Real-world use: Admin dashboards, chat apps, or applications where SEO is not critical.


### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

* Default behavior: Rendering happens on the server for every request.
* The server prepares full HTML (with data) and sends it to the browser.
* When to use: SEO-focused pages such as blogs, news, or e-commerce product pages.
* Best for: Content that changes on every request, for example, logged-in user dashboards.



### Static Site Generation (SSG)

* Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML.
* No server computation is needed at request time.
* Benefits: Super fast and CDN-friendly.
* When to use: Content that rarely changes, such as marketing sites, documentation, or blogs.



### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

* A hybrid of SSG and SSR.
* Pages are pre-rendered at build time like SSG.
* Pages automatically refresh in the background after a set interval (`revalidate`).
* When to use: Content that doesn’t change often but still needs periodic updates, such as blogs, documentation, or marketing pages.
