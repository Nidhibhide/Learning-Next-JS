## Next.js Basics

1. Next.js is a React framework. It’s like an upgraded version of React, created by Vercel.
2. SEO Friendly – It can show data to Google, which is good for ranking.



### Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

* Rendering happens in the browser using JavaScript.
* When to use: Highly interactive apps such as dashboards and single-page applications.
* Client side handles both rendering and data fetching.
* Real-world use: Admin dashboards, chat apps, or applications where SEO is not critical.


### Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

* Default behavior: Rendering happens on the server for every request.
* The server prepares full HTML (with data) and sends it to the browser.
* When to use: SEO-focused pages such as blogs, news, or e-commerce product pages.
* Best for: Content that changes on every request, for example, logged-in user dashboards.



### Static Site Generation (SSG)

* Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML.
* No server computation is needed at request time.
* Benefits: Super fast and CDN-friendly.
* When to use: Content that rarely changes, such as marketing sites, documentation, or blogs.



### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

* A hybrid of SSG and SSR.
* Pages are pre-rendered at build time like SSG.
* Pages automatically refresh in the background after a set interval (`revalidate`).
* When to use: Content that doesn’t change often but still needs periodic updates, such as blogs, documentation, or marketing pages.

-Scripts of next js 
1]next dev - start development server 
2]next start - start production server 

-File and folder structure 
1]public - The folder contains static assests i.e images , etc
2]If i create folder like 'about' in that i created 'about.jsx' file then it never display page after run '/about' It should be named as 'page.jsx' not even index.jsx 

-check about <metha name="viewport" content> check for responsiveness

-i know about next js how we use meta tag but how we have used in react js 
-what is use of authors tag in meta data 
-add fav icon in app 

-Client and Server component 
    A.Client Comp - 
        1.In React , we every component is Client component 
        2.If RCC imports another component that imported one becomes a RCC too , even If it doesnt have "use client" (i.e RSC)
        3.Client Comp executes on the server as well as on the client i.e Browser

    B.Server Comp - 
        1.In Next.Js , by default every component is React Server Component 
        2.In RSC , " USE API KEYS,TOKENS AND OTHER SECRETS WITHOUT EXPOSING THEM TO CLIENT. i.e network tab from browser but in RCC we can see info easily.
        3.Server comp execute only on the server . why ? ? ?









-Dynamic Route Segments 
1]params - we can get value pf dynamic routing URL 
2]Example of dynamic routing and nesting routes
3]We can use only Dynamic Routes Segments in Server Components.
4]How to implement in RCC using useParams()

1]searchParams - its like query paramter for filtering , sorting and pagination 
2]Example of Filtering , sorting , pagination , search , dynamic deals in RSC 

1]useSearchParams - It same working like searchParams used in RCC
2]Use getAll() to get multiple values ,

1]catch all segments in URL params [...slug] ( in RSC)
2]Implementation in RCC using useParams()

-Data Fetching in RSC
1]Use fetch api and pass data via search Query
2]Add validation for no data passsed and empty string too
API = https://api.genderize.io/?name=peter

-Data Fetching in RCC
1]Use fetch api and pass data via search Query
2]Add validation for no data passsed and empty string too
API = https://api.genderize.io/?name=peter

Examples 
1]useRouter() with methods 
2]redirect()
3]Static and dynamic rendering in Production & devlopment mode .
4]Hyderation Error in development & Production mode 
5]Caching (`no-store`, `revalidate`)



-useRouter() Hook in RCC
1]wE can get it from 2 ways i.e next/router , next/navigation 
2]The useRouter() hook allows you to programmatically change routes inside RCC.
3]Methods : 
    1.router.push() - Perform a client side navigation to provided route.
    2.router.replace() - Perform client side navigation to provided without adding new route.
    3.router.refresh() - refresh current route .
4]Use next/router if you are using Page Router , otherwise next/navigation if you are using App Router.

-redirect() in RSC
1]Working like useRouter() and use redirect from next/navigation 
2]But redirect should be called outside from try block coz redirect must throw error if it outside try block it will handle by next.js
If we have to use in try block then , catch and throw that error manually 


-Static Rendering
1]runs once at build time 
2]Database call , Normal fetch comes under static rendering 
3]If page does NOT depend on request-specific data , It becomes Static.

-Dynamic Rendering
1]SearchParams , headers() , cookies() , useSearchParams() , fetch with cache:'no-store ,
when u manually mark a page as dynamic i.e export const dynamic ='force-dynamic' includes in dynamic pages .
2]If page depends on: User input , URL query , Headers , Cookies It becomes Dynamic.

- Production mode (npm run build & npm start ) vs development mode (npm run dev)
1]Changes after npm run build not affected for that we need to again run npm run build ( staic & dynamic pages both)

-Hydration
1]Steps = Server sends HTML -> Browser displays it -> React loads JS -> React connects events -> Button works 
2]Making the server-rendered HTML interactive in the browser.
3]If value changes between: Server render & Browser render Hydration error will happen.
