### 1. CSR (Client-Side Rendering)

* Rendering happens in the browser using JavaScript.
* **When to use:** Highly interactive apps (dashboards, SPAs).
* **Client Side:** Handles both rendering and data fetching.
* **Real-world use:** Admin dashboards, chat apps, where SEO is not critical.

---

### 2. SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

* Default behavior: Rendering happens on the server for every request.
* Server prepares full HTML (with data) and sends it to the browser.
* **When to use:** SEO-focused pages (blogs, news, e-commerce product pages).
* **Best for:** Content that changes on every request (e.g., logged-in user dashboards).

---

### 3. SSG (Static Site Generation)

* Pages are generated at build time and served as static HTML.
* No server computation needed at request time.
* **Benefits:** Super fast, CDN-friendly.
* **When to use:** Content that never/rarely changes (marketing sites, documentation, blogs).

---

### 4. ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

* A hybrid of SSG and SSR.
* Page is pre-rendered at build time like SSG.
* Automatically refreshes in the background after a set interval (`revalidate`).
* **When to use:** Content that doesnâ€™t change often but still needs periodic updates (blogs, docs, marketing pages).
